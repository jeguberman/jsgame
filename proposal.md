Spaceman


### Pitch

Spaceman is a game where the player controls an astronaut via an MMU through a derelict space station collecting 3 data nodes. Pushing up on the D-pad accelerates the astronaut, pushing down decelerates the astronaut. Left and right represent rotation. WASD controls will also be supported.

The hook is that the astronaut will remain in the center of the view screen at all times, and instead of rotating the astronaut, the entire level will rotate.

### Controls
  * W, UP: Move the level down (Accelerate the spaceman)
  * A, LEFT: rotate the level direction 1
  * D, RIGHT: rotate the level direction 2
  * S, DOWN: Move the level up
  * SPACEBAR: Decelerate in all directions

### Functionality and MVPs
  * Players can start, pause and reset the game
  * Players can move the spaceman around the space station
  * Players can collect Data Nodes

### Bonus Features
  * The level can feature moving parts (similar to moving platforms)
  * The level has dangerous surfaces that kill the player (force reset)
  * The player bounces off walls, preserving a fraction of momentum
  * The player must manage a fuel and air meter
